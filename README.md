# Vagrant for Singularity

This repository is not supported by Singularity. I share it because I wanted to have a newer version of Singularity than is offered by the default provided Vagrant file. 

# Original README text:
This is a legacy repository of Vagrantfile collections to assist with Singularity development. We recommend that you follow instructions for using Vagrant on the [Singularity Documentation](http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-mac) site that takes advantage of pre-built boxes for each version of Singularity.
